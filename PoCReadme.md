## Branded Links


### Implemented Tests
We add two more cases; the firts one try to create a branded links and another in which the name of the branded link is not introduced. This ensures that our implementation create normal links and branded links correctly. This new tests are in `core/src/test/kotlin/es/unizar/urlshortener/core/usecases/CreateShortUrlUseCaseTest.kt`
