## Redirection limit
The Redirection Limit feature is done to limit the amount of times a user can shorten a URL in a given time period. This feature is useful for preventing abuse of the URL shortening service by limiting the number of shortened URLs a user can create in a given time period. We can set the limit of the number of shortened URLs they can create in a given time period and also set the time period for which the limit is enforced. If the user exceeds the limit, they will receive an error message and will not be able to shorten any more URLs until the time period has elapsed.

### Implementation:
First of all, we have added a new field in the UserEntity to store the number of shortened URLs created by the user. This field is called `rediections` and is of type `Int`. We have also added a new field called `lastRedirectionTimeStamp` to store when the last shortened URL was created by the user. This field is of type `OffsetDateTime` and can be null if the user has not shortened an url yet.
For the logged users, in the post method, before creating the shortened url, we check how much time has passed from the last redirection, if it has been more than an hour, we restore the number of redirection of the user to 0. Then, we check if the user has reached the limit of redirections, if it has, we return an error message. If it has not, we increase the number of redirections of the user by one and we save the time of the redirection in the lastRedirectionTimeStamp field, and then we create the shortened url.
For the non-logged users, the problem was bigger, as we do not have them in our database. We have solved this problem my using a concurrent hashmap to store temporarily, the ip of the user and the number of redirections they have done. We have also stored the time of the last redirection of the user. We check as before with the logged-user but now using the hash map. 
The error message when the user has reached the limit is a 429 error, which is a too many requests error.

### Instruction to test the redirection limit:
First you have to run the app doing gradlew bootRun. Then you have to go to the browser and write localhost:8080. Once you are there, you can write an URL you want to short. If you submit, the shortUrl will be shown. If you try to shorten more than 6 urls in an hour, you will receive a 429 error. If you wait an hour, you will be able to shorten more urls.
