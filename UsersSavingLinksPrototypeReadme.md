##  Enable users to save their links
### Description of the WP

This feature enables user authentication and personalized link management within the application. Through Google OAuth integration, users can log in, create accounts, and manage their unique collections of links. The application maintains link-specific data, including click counts, target URLs, and  QR code. Each user can create, view, and delete links, with their link data stored securely in the database under a unique user identifier (sub), providing a straightforward way to track ownership and link-specific metrics.

This Working Prototipe delivers a fully operational system that satisfies all the basic requirements outlined for this feature. The prototype enables users to create an account, log in securely using Google OAuth, and manage their links efficiently. Users can save shortened links, which are stored in a relational database along with relevant metadata such as click count and the original URL. The system also allows users to retrieve their saved links, displaying details like the number of clicks, the target URL, and QR codes. Additionally, users can delete any saved link directly from their account.

- We updated the file `/core/src/main/kotlin/es/unizar/urlshortener/core/Domain.kt` to include additional attributes in the Click data class, specifically the clicks attribute, which tracks the number of times a link has been accessed. This enhancement is essential for providing users with detailed information about their saved links. Simultaneously, we updated `/repositories/src/main/kotlin/es/unizar/urlshortener/infrastructure/repositories/Entities.kt` to reflect this change in the database structure. The Click entity now includes a clicks field, ensuring that this information is stored persistently. We also updated the converters to handle the new clicks attribute during transformations between domain objects and entities, both for saving data to the database and retrieving it.

- We updated `/repositories/src/main/kotlin/es/unizar/urlshortener/infrastructure/repositories/Repositories.kt` to enhance the functionality of the User and Link repositories. New methods were added to interact with the database more effectively, including a function to delete a link by its ID, a function to count the total number of clicks associated with a specific link, and a function to retrieve a Click entity by its hash. These additions ensure comprehensive support for managing user data and link-related operations, providing the necessary tools for efficient database interaction.

- Additionally, we implemented the GetUserInformationUseCase in `core/src/main/kotlin/es/unizar/urlshortener/core/usecases/CreateShortUrlUseCase.kt`, which centralizes user-related functionalities. This use case first checks if a user already exists in the database; if not, it inserts a new user entry, ensuring proper registration before users can create links. It also allows users to insert a sample link, providing them with a quick way to test or demonstrate functionality within their accounts. Furthermore, the use case includes a method to retrieve all links associated with a specific user.

- We implemented the DeleteLinkUseCase in `core/src/main/kotlin/es/unizar/urlshortener/core/usecases/DeleteLinkUseCase.kt`, which centralizes the functionality for deleting links. This use case allows users to remove specific links from their accounts while ensuring that all associated data, such as clicks, is handled appropriately.

- Additionally, we modified the existing LogClickUseCase and CreateShortUrlUseCase in `core/src/main/kotlin/es/unizar/urlshortener/core/usecases` to align them with the requirements of this feature. The LogClickUseCase was updated to ensure that clicks are recorded in relation to specific users and their links, while the CreateShortUrlUseCase now includes logic to associate new shortened URLs with the correct user, further integrating user and link management into the system.

### Justification for the choice of any additional libraries or frameworks
No additional libraries or frameworks beyond those already present in the project have been added. We leveraged the existing dependencies to implement the required functionalities, ensuring consistency and minimizing unnecessary complexity in the codebase. This approach allowed us to build the feature efficiently while maintaining the simplicity and coherence of the project’s architecture.

### Challenged encountered and how they were addressed 
The main challenges we faced once again revolved around understanding the project’s architecture and correctly applying the necessary changes. Grasping how the various components interacted and ensuring our modifications aligned with the existing design required significant effort. This involved carefully analyzing the flow of data and the dependencies between different modules. To address these challenges, we revisited the project’s documentation and thoroughly reviewed the source code to deepen our understanding of its structure and logic. 

### Instructions to run the WP
To run the WP, you will need to open your terminal and navigate to the project's root directory. Once there, execute the command `./gradlew bootRun` to start the application. After the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to the application's UI. From there, click on the "Log In / Register" button to begin the authentication process. You will be prompted to log in or register, and once you complete the process, you can interact with the user interface to test the functionality, including link management and user registration. This approach allows you to verify the seamless integration of the core features through the UI.
